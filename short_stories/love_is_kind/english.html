        <p class="text-lg story-text">Once upon a time, in a bustling farm barn, lived an inventive little mouse named Molly. She was always busy exploring and inventing new things.</p>
        <p class="text-lg story-text">One sunny day, Molly saw a tiny ant struggling to carry a big piece of leaf back to its colony. The leaf was much larger than the ant and it seemed to be having a really hard time.</p>
        <p class="text-lg story-text">Molly wanted to help, but when she told the other barn animals, they just laughed. "Why bother?" they said. "Ants don't need help. They're too small to matter." Molly was unsure. But then, she remembered her grandmother's words: "Love is kind, Molly."</p>
        <p class="text-lg story-text">With that in mind, Molly set to work. She found some twigs and a fallen leaf, and with her quick paws, she constructed a small cart. She carefully placed the ant's leaf on the cart and then gently pushed it towards the ant colony.</p>
        <p class="text-lg story-text">The ant was amazed and grateful! Back at the colony, the other ants celebrated. Even the smallest of creatures mattered, and even the smallest of kind acts could make a big difference.</p>
        <p class="text-lg story-text">The barn animals watched in surprise. Molly's kindness had turned an ordinary day into a small celebration. And on that day, Molly learned that love was indeed kind, and even the smallest act of kindness was a big act of love.</p>
        <p class="text-lg story-text">The end.</p>
